            <thetext>If you get an error or warning in a system include file (which typically reside outside of the workspace directory) then you can&apos;t give a file reference to the marker.  The result is that the user cannot double click on the problem and be taken to the location in the editor.

ErrorParserManager has a couple of utility functions to get an IFile for you from a path but unless the path resides in the workspace it won&apos;t work.  Even if the error parser implemetor creates an IFile resource for the file and passes it to generateMarker it still doesn&apos;t work.  In this case nothing is shown in the problems view at all.  I think there is probably an exception being thrown.</thetext>

            <thetext>You can only create markers on IResources. Since the external files aren&apos;t IResources, you simply can&apos;t do this.

But it is a good requirement that needs a solution. Hopefully someone will think of something innovative and come up with one.</thetext>

            <thetext>Here is something innovative:

- If the error parser cannot create an IFile object for a given path then it attaches the problem marker to the project. That&apos;s why the file cannot be opened in a simple way from the problems view
- A new marker type could be defined which has an additional attribute like &quot;externalLocation&quot; (derived from the standard C/C++ problem marker)
- The error parser could be made to use the the new type, still use the project as resource but store the original path of the error in the marker&apos;s externalLocation attribute
- An popup menu object contribution for the new marker type could be created, as an analogy of the Delete C/C++ Marker contribution which allows manually deleting C/C++ Markers. The new contribution would say: &quot;Open External File&quot;. An action would be provided to open the external file in an editor and place the cursor in the appropriate position.

The main drawback of this is the fact that the user must know or guess that while double-clicking does not work, he can still get the file opened via a popup menu action. I would have liked to somehow override the default double-click action for the Problems view but I could not figure out how to do this. The current action which is caused by the double-click is hard-coded into the ProblemView class and it&apos;s framework

Another drawback is that annotiations probably also won&apos;t work for the external file. I&apos;ll have to think about this some more, maybe we can configure the CEditors annotation access ...

Anyway I would like opinions on whether this is worth doing in spite of the drawbacks, or whether other, more elegant ways of doing this can be imagined.</thetext>

&gt; - A new marker type could be defined which has an additional attribute like
&gt; &quot;externalLocation&quot; (derived from the standard C/C++ problem marker)
I think this could be applied to any text marker.

&gt; file. I&apos;ll have to think about this some more, maybe we can configure the
&gt; CEditors annotation access ...

Have you looked at ExternalSearchAnnotationModel and DebugMarkerAnnotationModel? They try to solve the same thing, kind of.
ExternalSearchAnnotationModel does not provide any annotations for markers currently, but can be quite easily changed to do so. The drawback is that it is only used when the file is opened with ExternEditorInput and ExternalSearchEditor. 
DebugMarkerAnnotationModel supports breakpoints only, but works generically for all editor inputs and editors. I think we need a common solution for any marker type and any editor input/editor, otherwise it depends on the way a file is opened whether it will show problem markers or breakpoints - but not both.

This patch introduces the new marker type and the action to open the editor

Submitting an initial patch to create a sketch of a solution. What this patch does:

- Define a new marker type
- Change the error parser infrastructure so that markers of this type, including the external location, are generated
- An action contribution to open an editor for the external location

Second thoughts about this implementation:

- Perhaps a new marker type is not required. We could just define the org.eclipse.cdt.core.problem marker to always have the externalLocation attribute. In many cases this attribute would simply not be set.

Known defects:

- my new externalProblem markers don&apos;t have the &quot;Delete C/C++ Marker&quot; popup menu item which is contributed for the standard problem marker. I thought that by setting the super element type to org.eclipse.cdt.core.problem the menu item would be inherited. Any ideas?
- The IMarkerGenerator interface must be extended by another method signature. Currently to my knowledge only classes in org.eclipse.cdt.core.tests get broken. Should I go to more trouble to avoid breaking things? Or is the extension of the interface ok?
- The way the editor is opened and directed to the correct line is done without much internal knowledge.

Items to be done:

- Make sure that the ExternalSearchEditor gets opened.
- Modify marker support so that the problem markers for the external file are also displayed.</thetext>

Do the marker definitions and also support marker annotation display in external editor

This patch does all the patch before did plus adding an OpenExternalProblemAction which opens the ExternalSearchEditor for the referenced location. By a little tweak to the ExternalSearchAnnotationModel the markers are now being displayed in the correct place even in the external editor.

Design considerations:

- Decide whether a new marker type is necessary, or a new attribute for the &quot;normal&quot; CDT problemMarker is sufficient
- Is it OK to reuse the ExternalSearchEditor for displaying problem markers? (I think it is)
- Review and clean-up the implementation
- Provide unit tests
- Create a new bugzilla which will depend on #155379 and will be resolved when the external editor is opened upon double-click. In this way this current bug can be resolved and we don&apos;t forget that for external markers opening the external editor should ideally be triggered from a double-click and not from an extra context menu entry.
- Create a nice icon for the action (suggestions, anybody?)

I&apos;d love to have opinions on my suggested implementation.</thetext>

&gt; editor.
The annotation model should filter the markers according to the file location, otherwise it would include markers for all external files associated with the same resource (#isAcceptable).
I would also vote for reusing the existing marker type(s).</thetext>

Reworked implementation which filters by location

The implementation has been sleeping (maturing, of course) for two months now. I have reworked it to suit the following requirements:

- I am reusing the standard C/C++ marker type and it has an additional attribute which is filled only for problems on external files.
- The annotation model does filter by location now which is necessary because markers for multiple files are all stuck on to the containing project. (isAcceptable() implementation)

I tried to use existing JUnits to verify that my implementation does not break any existing things but found it was pretty confusing. Numerous tests from the org.eclipse.cdt.core.tests fail, also from tests which are related to external error parsing, such as GCCErrorParserTests. These tests are not in the nightly build test suite so I have no idea whether they should work or not. Btw I also tried in a different workspace to run them with the HEAD from the repository unmodified and they fail even under such circumstances.

I felt that the IMarkerGenerator interface was a little clumsy with it&apos;s long parameter lists, and I worked up a suggestion to make the ErrorParserManager.Problem class public and top-level under the more descriptive name ProblemMarkerInfo, and to use this wrapper object in the IMarkerGenerator.addMarker() interface. I am leaving the old version in place, but have marked it as deprecated.

For the implementation of the filtering in ExternalSearchAnnotationModel.isAcceptable() I had to get information about the project and external location path of the markers into the annotation model. I did it by extending the ExternalFileEditorInput, introducing among others a new constructor. I am confident that it will still be working correctly also in the old contexts, but it would be good to hear some comments 
from somebody who knows his way around here (Anton?)

So, here is the suggested patch, any more comments or opinions?</thetext>

            <thetext>Looks good to me, just some comments on the ExternalSearchAnnotationModel:
- The attribute for the external location is defined different in the plugin.xml (don&apos;t know if this attribute declaration has any effect at all).
- isAcceptable allows only C problem markers. Rather, I&apos;d suggest to not filter the type. This allows to use the mechanism for other marker types, too (e.g. breakpoints).
- retrieveMarkers should not findMarkers with DEPTH_INFINITE, because we don&apos;t want to get all markers of all resources inside a project.
- The model does not listen to resource changes, ie. it does not update itself if eg. a marker is deleted. Actually, I think we can base the annotation model on the ResourceMarkerAnnotationModel which handles this already.
- One last point ;-) The ExternalEditorInput could be a little bit smarter and guess the marker resource from the ITranslationUnit (ie. the IProject it is associated with), thus the markers also appear when the input has been created without explicit marker resource, but there still remains the problem that a file opened with an IStorage only, will not show the problem markers. As a workaround, one could get all markers from the workspace root with DEPTH_ONE to cover all projects...</thetext>

            <thetext>Anton, thanks for your fast reply. Mine is not so fast.

&gt; - The attribute for the external location is defined different in the
&gt; plugin.xml (don&apos;t know if this attribute declaration has any effect at all).
I changed this. The declaration may be important for the persistence of the marker. Even though attributes can apparently created and read without being declared the persistence mechanism may depend on the declarations. I did not try this, however.

&gt; - isAcceptable allows only C problem markers. Rather, I&apos;d suggest to not filter
&gt; the type. This allows to use the mechanism for other marker types, too (e.g.
&gt; breakpoints).
Right. Filtering by the existence of the externalLocation attribute is strict enough. 

&gt; - retrieveMarkers should not findMarkers with DEPTH_INFINITE, because we don&apos;t
&gt; want to get all markers of all resources inside a project.
Sure. DEPTH_ZERO is perfectly enough.

&gt; - The model does not listen to resource changes, ie. it does not update itself
&gt; if eg. a marker is deleted. Actually, I think we can base the annotation model
&gt; on the ResourceMarkerAnnotationModel which handles this already.
OK, I changed this too. Made the implementation of the ExternalSearchAnnotationModel smaller and cleaner.

I have two new concerns:

- Will the original external search stuff still be displayed correctly after my changes. Markers from external search will not have the externalLocation attribute set. They should be filtered out. How can I test this?
- I have now figured out how to create a translation unit from an external include file&apos;s path and how to open the C editor on the file. This is even better that the external editor because now the outline also is alive. The drawback at the moment is that I need to fiddle with another marker annotation model (the C editor&apos;s) and have not yet figured out where to start. (Attempts with the TranslationUnitAnnotationModel did not succeed ...) A few pointers would be greatly appreciated.

I&apos;ll post the updated patch shortly ...</thetext>

This patch has learned how to open the C editor

This patch can open the C editor on external files which have error markers. It does not yet display the markers in the editor as annotations. I&apos;ll have to do some more research for this ...</thetext>

Search does not set markers anymore, instead the search adds annotations dynamically when an editor is opened, therefore this is not influenced by the change.

I have committed a change to CDocumentProvider which uses the ExternalSearchAnnotationModel as fallback model. Thus the markers for external files are also shown in the CEDitor (I had to comment out part of the change as it depends on your patch).</thetext>

Works great. I&apos;ll attach the patch including your changes for documentation purposes and commit it now.

            <thetext>Thanks for the fix.  I&apos;ve been hooking it up with our builder and errors parsers and it&apos;s working great.  One problem I noticed though is when you open problems in source files that are external to the workspace, they are not opened as source files (no c icon in editor tab).  The reason appears to be that CoreModel#createTranslationUnitFrom only looks at includes (IIncludeReference&apos;s).

I guess this is sort of outside of the scope of this particular bug so maybe I should log a new one for it?</thetext>

Warren,

since this bug is now long closed, and your problem is a trifle different, I&apos;d prefer if you&apos;d open a new one.

Thx,

            <thetext>Hi,

Under different circumstances ( Opening an XML file, running the update manager, opening a &apos;rename file&apos; dialog ), eclipse hangs, and there is no way of making it return control.

            <thetext>Do you still see this? If so, please provide more information. The attacked .log shows a bug when preparing a preview but I cannot reproduce this.

Hangs forever, for a second?

            <thetext>We believe the default should always be to generate the doc-literal wrapped pattern (when the user selects doc-literal).  We have a few bugs where we sometimes don&apos;t generate this pattern.  So would you find it acceptable if we simply hide the wrapped/unwrapped option in the wizard and only support the &apos;wrapped&apos; generation pattern?</thetext>

            <thetext>Hi Craig,

I have gathered some feedbacks on the question you post and sent you an email.  Another question we have is whether this change can be made in WTP 1.5.1.

            <thetext>The org.eclipse.jst.common.project.facet.JavaFacetUtils class has a method call scheduleFullBuild(...), which does a full build against a project, and uses the workspace root as the scheduling rule. Instead of using the workspace root as the scheduling rule, the project should be used instead.</thetext>

            <thetext>I chased down what JDT does in this situation. They call ResourcesPlugin.getWorkspace().getRuleFactory().buildRule() to get the appropriate rule to run the build job with. I thought, great it must be some sort of clever mechanism that only grabs as much as necessary, but when I looked at the implementation, the buildRule() method simply returns the IWorkspaceRoot. It appears that in order to do any build (even if it is a build of one project), the entire workspace must be locked. I will go ahead and change the JavaFacetUtils code to use the buildRule() method so that if it becomes more optimal in the future we will pickup the changes, but there will not be any user-visible changes for now.</thetext>

            <thetext>The Source.java file has two unresolved imports for the classes OutputFormat and
XMLSerializer
The following 2 imports are not resolved in the Source.java file:

import org.apache.xml.serialize.OutputFormat;
import org.apache.xml.serialize.XMLSerializer;

Organizing the imports (ctrl-shift o), changes these to:

import com.sun.org.apache.xml.internal.serialize.OutputFormat;
import com.sun.org.apache.xml.internal.serialize.XMLSerializer;

which do resolve the class imports correctly.</thetext>

5. DND both tasks to cp1
6. fix the configurations to be as follows: config1 has contentpak1 selected only. config2 has contentpak2 selected only
7. create cp3 with config3
8. Switch configuration to config1. 
9. Deep copy cp1 into cp3. Answer &quot;No&quot; to add only things from the current config (which is config1)
results=&gt; after deep copy and with config3 selected both task1 and task2 are displayed. 
expedted=&gt; task2 should not have been copied since it belongs to config2 not config1</thetext>

            <thetext>The IProgressMonitor passed into AbstractCLaunchDeleate.preLaunchCheck(), buildForLaunch(), and finalLaunchCheck() is not handled according to the contract specified in the following white paper:

http://www.eclipse.org/articles/Article-Progress-Monitors/article.html

and thus suffers from some of the problems mentioned in the paper, like incorrect work counts and multiple beginTask()/done() pairs on the same monitor.  The latter is particularly problematic for me because I am trying to provide a command-line launch command which must be synchronous to support scripting.

I have a proposed fix which I will post once I have reviewed it here.</thetext>

            <thetext>I20060725-0800

I wasn&apos;t able to reproduce your case. Here&apos;s what I did:

1. Checked in a copy of org.eclipse.ftp into my local cvs server

2. With a new workspace, I checked out two versions of org.eclipse.ftp (named org.eclipse.ftp and org.eclipse.ftp2) 

3. Modified the .project file in org.eclipse.ftp and committed it

4. Selected org.eclipse.ftp2 and chose Team&gt;Synchronize with Repository; have 1 incomign change (.project file)

4. Right click on the project and chose &quot;Override and Update&quot; (I also tried just selecting the .project file)

5. Prompted to Overwrite local changes-&gt;Yes-&gt;changes updated properly.

From your description, it seems what might have happened is that your workspace might have gotten out of sync with what&apos;s on disk. That message will pop up if you already have a .project file on disk, but doesn&apos;t show up in the navigator. Try doing a refresh on the project and things should work. Please reopen this bug with further details if this doesn&apos;t address your problem. Thanks!</thetext>

            <thetext>What you say is correct.  I believe the resource was out of synch.  

I think the workflow in this case is incorrect, if you choose overwrite local with incoming then it should overwrite independent of whether the resource has changed without eclipse realizing it, after all you did choose &quot;overwrite&quot;.  

If that is inconsistent with eclipse practices then perhaps changing the error message to indicate the true problem &quot;that the resource is out of synch with the workspace&quot; is the best solution.</thetext>

            <thetext>I think the best place to start would be to improve the error message. However, we probably won&apos;t have time to look at this for 3.3.</thetext>

            <thetext>The following code throws a ResourceException when the default encoding is UTF-8 (for example on Fedora Core Linux 4 and 5)

ICompilationUnit unit = a compilation unit corresponding to a file that does not exist
ICompilationUnit working_copy = (ICompilationUnit) unit.getWorkingCopy (
            null, null, null);
IBuffer buffer = working_copy.getBuffer();
buffer.setContents(&quot;blah blah&quot;);
buffer.save(null, true);

This throws a ResourceException at Buffer.java line 361
The problem is that IFile.getContentDescription throws the exception when the file does not exist.

The obvious fix is to skip the enclosing if block if the file does not exist, but the if block is there to fix another bug, so I am not sure if this is the right fix.</thetext>

            <thetext>In my effort to use the new javaStream file, I am getting null names loading resulting in an error in NamedDefnList. If I correct this logic to support null names, then my segment names become unrecognized and fail validation. This code sequence was supported under the db file load.

Exception in thread &quot;main&quot; org.eclipse.ohf.ihe.pdq.consumer.PdqConsumerException: java.lang.NullPointerException

Here is a JUNIT:

            <thetext>The exception happens in the method:
	public NamedDefn namedItemByName(String value) {
		for (int i = 0; i &lt; size() ; i++ )
			if (namedItem(i).getName().equals(value))
				return namedItem(i);
		return null;
	}
When 
i == 0
(the first iteration) the &quot;namedItem&quot; method returns a NamedDefn object with 
pathName = seg-[
and the fields &quot;name&quot; and &quot;description&quot; are null.
The &quot;fields&quot; vector is empty.

So the null pointer exception happens because the &quot;equals(value)&quot; method is calling a null object.</thetext>

            <thetext>I reconfigured the tests, and was able to create this error in the tests, but I got it while loading the stream, not while trying to use a message.

I updated the stream, and now everything works again.

Everything is committed now, please try again. I&apos;m a little skeptical that I&apos;ve fixed the same problem though.</thetext>

            <thetext>Running with the newest updates in CVS, this bug is still at issue; although now I receive a different error - not during message create but rather at message validation. My former workaround in place resolves it for now:

	public String getName() {
		
		int lastSep = getPath().lastIndexOf(PATH_SEPARATOR);
		return getPath().substring(lastSep+1);
		//return name;
	}

Here is a good getName call result:
getname: 83 out of 162 MSH (value)* MSH (name) ^ null-2.5-seg-MSH (path)

Here is what I get using javaStream:
getname: 83 out of 162 null (value) * MSH (name) ^ test-2.5-seg-MSH (path)

Here is an update to the JUNIT:

	public void testNullBug() throws HL7V2Exception {
		
		//set-up with javaStream (vs access db)		
		Stream loadFile = new Stream(new File(&quot;C:\\workspace\\hl7Definitions.javaStream&quot;));
		MessageManager globalFactory = MessageManager.getFactory();
		globalFactory.setVersionDefinitions(loadFile.load());
		DefinitionValidator defVal = new DefinitionValidator();
				
		//create message object
		Message msg = globalFactory.createMessage();
		msg.clear();
		msg.setDefinitions(globalFactory.getVersionDefinitions());
		msg.setVersion(VersionDefnList.hv25);

		//create MSH segment
		Segment mshSegment = new Segment();
		mshSegment.setCode(&quot;MSH&quot;);         // &lt;&lt; remove population of segment and this it works
		msg.getSegments().add(mshSegment);
		
		//verify segment
		defVal.validate(msg);
		ValidationItemList defItems = defVal.getItems();
		for (int i=0; i &lt; defItems.size(); i++) {
			System.out.println(&quot;Client: verifyMessage - level &quot; + defItems.item(i).getType() + &quot; - &quot; + defItems.item(i).getMessage());
		}
		if (defItems.size() &gt; 0) {
			throw new HL7V2Exception(&quot;validate error&quot;,0);

            <thetext>Having taken a new copy of the hl7v2.core in CVS, I get a new location for this same error. The &quot;name&quot; variable is null and this causes a nullPointerException.

Exception in thread &quot;main&quot; java.lang.NullPointerException
 at org.eclipse.ohf.hl7v2.core.definitions.model.DataTypeDefn.escapable(DataTypeDefn.java:47)

changing this:
public boolean escapable() {
     return name.equals(&quot;ST&quot;) || name.equals(&quot;TX&quot;) || name.equals(&quot;FT&quot;) || name.equals(&quot;CF&quot;) || name.charAt(0) == &apos;*&apos;;

to:
public boolean escapable() {

	return name.equals(&quot;ST&quot;) || name.equals(&quot;TX&quot;) || name.equals(&quot;FT&quot;) || name.equals(&quot;CF&quot;) || name.charAt(0) == &apos;*&apos;;

(ie working off the path variable instead of the name variable keeps the program running)</thetext>

            <thetext>Right. This was a lovely bug. It&apos;s some issue in the 1.4 object serialization. Sondra and I were running with the same code but different jre&apos;s and it bugged differently. Always worked under jre 5. 

Fixed by replacing that piece of code entirely. I believe that this will fix all the related issues</thetext>

            <thetext>The new rewrite indeed appears to fix my problem. A revision note would be great to know what changed in the future! :)

Here is what I think I had to change:

For others the old use:
import org.eclipse.ohf.hl7v2.core.definitions.formats.Stream
Config.SERIALIZED_PATH = \\org.eclipse.ohf.hl7v2.ui\\Resources\\hl7Definitions.javaStream
Stream javaStream = new Stream(new File(Config.SERIALISED_PATH));
globalFactory.setVersionDefinitions(javaStream.load());

New use:
import org.eclipse.ohf.hl7v2.core.definitions.formats.PrivateFormat
Config.SERIALIZED_PATH = \\org.eclipse.ohf.hl7v2.ui\\Resources\\hl7Definitions.stream
PrivateFormat javaStream = new PrivateFormat(new File(Config.SERIALISED_PATH));
globalFactory.setVersionDefinitions(javaStream.load());</thetext>

            <thetext>If I only have a few files checked out, when I try to format all the source code in my project, the formatter stops, since it detects some of my files being read-only.

It should not halt at read-only files, instead it should just skip them and only format the writable files.

It would provide better usability, as it will do as much as possible, which in this case is exactly what I want.

Note, this issue is not related to the following bugs 27207, 69193, and 121552 that want to format the read-only files.  I do not want that!</thetext>

Pressing F1 for context help within the editor and selecting 
the &quot;Extension Point Schema Editor&quot; topic gives a &quot;topic not available&quot; 
error message.  

Google shows a link to help from 3.0, but not 3.1 or 3.2. 
In the 3.2 help topics, the Tools/Editors section of the PDE Guide shows 
nothing on the schema editor; nor do I see anything under JDT nor Platform.</thetext>

1.In a CP, create an activity and sub-activies:
  CP1
    A1
      t1      (associated with role and WP descriptors)
      A1.1
         t1.1 ( this is associated with role and WP descriptors)
2.Let A1 contribute to another activity in a different CP.
3.Check browsing, ADD for A1 is not there. BUT ADD for A1.1 is displayed.</thetext>

            <thetext>From peter&apos;s email about the same defect: 
(from peter)
I created a pattern with two activities contributing to two different activities in OpenUP.  Both activities had the same task descriptor.  When I looked at the activities then in browsing mode I saw the new task in both places in the WBS.  Excellent.  

But here is the gap: It did publish an activity detail diagram, but without the new tasks.  The requirements state that it does not publish any activity diagrams, but what about the activity detail diagrams?  Because ADDs can be automatically generated and layouted. is it possible to create these with the contributed task?  If this is not possible then it should rather not display an ADD at all (better than an ADD that misses the contributed TDs)

            <thetext>There are two problems and both of them are related to SWT.MeasureItem. I have waited a long time for this enhancement. And I wish you guys can fix it as soon as possible.


Firstly when I have used this code:

	table = new Table(this, SWT.VIRTUAL | SWT.FULL_SELECTION | SWT.BORDER | SWT.CHECK);
	table.setLayoutData(new GridData(GridData.FILL, GridData.FILL, true, true));
	table.setLinesVisible(true);
	table.setHeaderVisible(true);

	table.addListener(SWT.MeasureItem, new Listener() {
			public void handleEvent(Event e) {

				e.height = 20;
			}
		});
 And change the first row background color to yellow. Lets look at the Table cell [0,0], it fills part of background color only.

 

Secondly when you select on a row and then move your mouse cursor within the selected row. Lets look at the Table cell [0,0] again, part of the table cell line is disappeared.

Actually there is one more problem. When I was going to create a customized selection color buy using the swt.painitem, after that just select a row and moving your mouse within the selected row. You will find that the table cell [0,0] always repaint itself. Sometime it makes the text disappear.</thetext>

            <thetext>I notice that you are running with -clean each time.  Can you try launching without the -clean option?  To make sure I understand you correctly:  

Every time you reboot your machine you are able to start eclipse once but eclipse will fail every time after that as long as your computer is not rebooted.  After eclipse fails to launch if you reboot you can then start eclipse once and only once but then it starts to fail again.

Is there anything special about your file system?  What type of file system is it?</thetext>

            <thetext>The WSDL validator does not properly handle inline schemas defined with namespaces that contain no scheme. More precisely, it is the import of other inline namespaces with no scheme that cause the problem. I&apos;ve attached a WSDL document that reproduces this problem.

Curiously, this problem only seems to manifest itself when the schema namespace is specified as the default namespace, as in

&lt;schema xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema&quot;...&gt;</thetext>

            <thetext>The problem was with the inline schema generator. The generator was trying to be too smart and appending (incorrectly) the namespace as the schema location for inline schemas with no namespace prefix (such as xsd) and an inline schema import element. I&apos;ve removed the offending code and added a unit test for this scenario.

Fix released to 1.5.1 and 2.0 streams.</thetext>

Language: English
Build: epf-composer-1.0-M4-N20060718-win32.zip

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a new Method Library.
2. Create a new Method Plug-in
3. Create a new Method Configurations, click File-&gt;Close all to save this configuration
4. Create a new Delivery Process named &quot;Test&amp;Test&quot;, and select a Method Configurations, press OK
5. Delivery Process created.
   ---&gt;Problem: The Delivery Process name is shown as a shortcut key, an underline with a character
 
Expected Result: The Delivery Process name should be shown as user inputted

Remarks:
1. The same problem on RHEL4U3(en_US.UTF-8)
2. When we delete the Delivery Process named with &quot;&amp;&quot;, the same problem occurs on some others interfaces
3. The invalid character for Delivery Process name is [/\;*?&quot;&lt;&gt;|]
4. The screen image is attached.</thetext>

            <thetext>This is the limitation from Eclipse Label class which is trimming the &quot;&amp;&quot; from method element name. 
Current behavior is : &quot;Test&amp;Test&quot; displayed as &quot;TestTest&quot;
                      &quot;Test&amp;&amp;Test&quot; displayed as &quot;Test&amp;Test&quot;
                      &quot;Test&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;Test&quot; displayed as &quot;Test&amp;&amp;Test&quot;
In fact &apos;&amp;&apos; on Method Element name may lead several issues on publishing ( i.e URLs will be inactive with &apos;&amp;&apos; on element name ).
Considering all of these, we have decided to restrict &apos;&amp;&apos; from name and from now onwards and error will be prompted if the user uses &apos;&amp;&apos;.

Thanks,

            <thetext>Due to the limitation of &quot;&amp;&quot; usage on Eclipse Label class, we are restricting &quot;&amp;&quot; on Method Element Name. Where are we do not do any validation on Presentation Name, users can use the same to specify if there is any &quot;&amp;&quot; char on the name.

Patch has been applied on 03/12/2007, 5.30 PM PST. Pls verify the same on appropriate build.

            <thetext>In WTP 1.0 J2EE utility projects and other dependent libraries, where automatically added to a EJB project&apos;s build path, when added as dependency to that EJB project. This was quite a nice feature, because build path and J2EE dependencies could be created in one go.

Now in 1.5 with the introduction of the EAR libraries build library the above feature has disappeared. Only EJB client (view) projects are added to the EAR libaries build path, but normal jar file (J2EE) dependencies, and not even J2EE utility jar files are added to the EAR libaries any more. Not only is this very combersom (one has to edit J2EE dependencies and build path separately), but it also will make developers not use the J2EE dependencies mechanism correctly, and just edit the build path - resulting in incorrect manifest classpath references.

So my conclusion is: normal jar references and J2EE utility references should also be added to the EAR libary build path.</thetext>

            <thetext>Hi Jason,

This may just be a misunderstanding of the &quot;derived&quot; classpath settings from MANIFEST...   Can you look into it?</thetext>

            <thetext>I suspect this is a duplicate of 147758  The EAR Libraries classpath container should be exported; if it is not exported on your workspace, then this is a duplicate; try grabbing the newest 1.5.1 build.

            <thetext>Trying to verfiy this bug with WTP 1.5.1 27 Jul 2006.

What do you mean by &quot;EAR Libraries classpath container should be exported&quot;? You mean as entry in the .classpath file?

Anyway - although J2EE utility projects are now listed in the build path &quot;EAR Libraries&quot;, normal jar files still are not. The jar file is listed in the ear &lt;project-modules&gt; descriptor as module:/classpath/var/... Shouldn&apos;t it also be listed in the same way in the ejb project&apos;s &lt;project-modules&gt; descriptor?</thetext>

            <thetext>Is this your scenario?

You have an EAR with a project module of any type (could be any a Utility EJB, AppClient, RAR or WAR).  The EAR references a jar file in one of the following 3 ways: 1 as jar from the workspace, 2 as an external jar, or 3 as an extended variable.  Then if you reference the jar from your project module it isn&apos;t added to the classpath.  

Here are the 3 examples (which all fail) from my .settings\org.eclipse.wst.common.component file of EAR project:

&lt;dependent-module deploy-path=&quot;/&quot; handle=&quot;module:/classpath/lib/BankRA/connectorModule/BankAdapter.jar&quot;&gt;
            &lt;dependency-type&gt;uses&lt;/dependency-type&gt;
        &lt;/dependent-module&gt;
        &lt;dependent-module archiveName=&quot;lib/D:/temp/BarTestClient.jar.jar&quot; deploy-path=&quot;/&quot; handle=&quot;module:/classpath/lib/D:/temp/BarTestClient.jar&quot;&gt;
            &lt;dependency-type&gt;uses&lt;/dependency-type&gt;
        &lt;/dependent-module&gt;
        &lt;dependent-module deploy-path=&quot;/&quot; handle=&quot;module:/classpath/var/JUNIT_HOME/junit.jar&quot;&gt;
            &lt;dependency-type&gt;uses&lt;/dependency-type&gt;
        &lt;/dependent-module&gt;

            <thetext>Exactly. In my case the jar file added to the ear is added by &quot;module:/classpath/var&quot;. But as in your case the &quot;lib&quot; reference types fail as well.</thetext>

            <thetext>Thanks for confirming the clarifiction; there was some confusion on my part before.  The EAR Libraries classpath container for the dependent projects should be picking these up.  It currently isn&apos;t.  :(</thetext>

            <thetext>Just an additional thought. We are working on creating ant scripts for building wtp projects automatically based on the wtp metadata. For that reason it would be nice if if also jar file references would be listed in the &lt;project-modules&gt; descriptor (and not only in manifest files) ... just a thought.

            <thetext>The manifest is the only place we will be listing the dependencies.  We ran into problems in the past trying to keep all the meta-data in synch with each other.  Things get especially tricky when the multiple meta-datas defining dependencies becomes out of synch (e.g. from forces outside the workbench).  So, we decided to make the manifest the one and only authority for project dependencies because that&apos;s how it will work at runtime.</thetext>

Following situation while editing java code
1. Method getXY()
2. delete XY (cursor is positioned between get and ()
3. STRG-SPACE for Completion list
4. Choose method YX

Now the code is getYX()(). In former versions it was getYX().

Maybe there is a option to disable this behavior (I havn&apos;t found)</thetext>

            <thetext>Move state management code out of SQLParser

Currently many state maintenance code specific to the parsed document is defined in SQLParser itself, such as getScope ( Returns the scope constant at the current position, which is used by content assist to retrieve database meta objects proposals ), getReferencedTables ( Returns referenced tables in the parsed sql statement ). Therere potential threading issues here: the API cant make sure the return value and the corresponding sql statement always match.
All these APIs should be moved from the singleton SQLParser to ParsingResult.</thetext>

            <thetext>Works for me using R3.2 and latest 3.3 build with Text and Java editor.

Do you mean the menu entries File &gt; &apos;...&apos; or do you talk about buttons? If so, you must have installed some additional pug-ins since Eclipse SDK does not have &apos;Revert&apos; and &apos;Save All&apos; buttons in the tool bar.

Also, in which editor do you see this?</thetext>

            <thetext>Yes i mean the File &gt; ... menu entries (sorry it are menuitems and not buttons)
I recognized it in java editor.

Is a possible cause of this a installed plugin? I use EclipseColorer 0.7.1 for editing xml files. Is it possible that plugins change the plattform behavior?</thetext>

Havn&apos;t found others. But Save and Save all sometimes are correct

I think you mean gtk apps. Never saw problems like that, but i realy don&apos;t know.
- can you attach a screen shot of enabled/disabled?
Sorry. Its not possible for me to make a sreenshot of the menu by gimp, because after i try to shot a picture the file menu is not opening. So you have to trust me.
- please also try plain Eclipse SDK

- select &quot;The whole screen&quot;
- specify a delay of a couple (say, 5) seconds
- click &quot;Grab&quot;
- switch to Eclipse
- open the menu
- wait until the delay has elapsed

            <thetext>I&apos;m developing two versions of the same plugin at the same time: A1 and A2. Also A1 depends on another plugin B1 and A2 depends on the same plugin, but a latter version: B2.

When I have all four plugins open at the same time in Eclipse 3.2, it seems that the classpath entries overlap and conflict. I have to close A1 and B1 if I want to work on A2 and B2, or the other way around.

I have other dependencies on those plugins, and I&apos;ve specified some version constraints in my plugins dependencies. Unfortunately, those constraints seem to be ignored at design time.

The temporary hack suggested in the newsgroup is to change the plugin ID: this works. But it&apos;s definitely a hack IMHO.

It there a solution to this problem? If not, could this be directly supported in the future?</thetext>

            <thetext>I&apos;ve noticed a visual inconsistency in my diagrams. When I create a new
node by doing a drag&amp;drop from the palette, the (editable) node label
isn&apos;t correctly centered after the dropping. I actually need to move the
node to force a sort of refresh and see the label properly aligned.

See the three screenshots at:

            <thetext>Jerome, I reproduce this in an editor I have with a node similar to yours.  Could you provide me with more information to reproduce this?  Does the problem only occur if you do a drag and drop from the palette and not when you select the palette tool and then click on the diagram?</thetext>

            <thetext>Cherie, I&apos;m still having the issue with the latest GMF release. Maybe this is due to the custom figure node that I&apos;m using. I will privately email to you so you can see if it is the cause of the problem.</thetext>

            <thetext>To reproduce in Tapain...
The problem is with long default values for labels.

 - open PortLocationFigure.java
 - replace &quot;&lt;...&gt;&quot; by &quot;_____________________&quot;
 - run the example
 - create a blank diagram
 - drop a Port node from the palette
 - when the text box is displayed for the lable just press Enter
 - see how the label is not centered
 - move a bit the node
 - see how the label centers itself after the move</thetext>

            <thetext>My class

public final class SimpleParametersTest { ... }

is huge and contains public and private methods, classes and a public interface.
I right-clicked on the class-name and selected &quot;Refactor-Extract supertype&quot;, ticked &quot;Use extracted superclass where possible&quot; and chose only to include the interface in the extracted superclass.

The interface was moved, but the extracted superclass also contained ALL OTHER code from the subclass, thus duplicating it.
The only difference I found was a protected in-line class that was made private in the superclass.

Best regards,
Henrik</thetext>

            <thetext>Content assist and syntax highlighting don&apos;t work on WML JSP with JSP Editor

Steps:
1. create a WML file whose extension is .jsp, containing the following content:
--- content of the file ---
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;ISO-8859-1&quot; ?&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE wml PUBLIC &quot;-//WAPFORUM//DTD WML 1.3//EN&quot; &quot;http://www.wapforum.org/DTD/wml13.dtd&quot;&gt;
&lt;wml&gt;&lt;head&gt;
&lt;%@ page language=&quot;java&quot; contentType=&quot;text/vnd.wap.wml; charset=ISO-8859-1&quot;%&gt;
&lt;meta http-equiv=&quot;Content-Type&quot;	content=&quot;text/vnd.wap.wml; charset=ISO-8859-1&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;card title=&quot;wml.jsp&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Place content here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/card&gt;
&lt;/wml&gt;
--- end of content ---
2. open the file with JSP Editor
 &gt;&gt; No content assist
 &gt;&gt; No syntax highlighting

Addition:
When I create .html and .wml files, content assist and syntax highlighting
works with HTML Editor.

            <thetext>I am getting an exception during generation. I have edited an ecore with the diagram editor and then generated the model with this exception: 

I am on the callisto release.

Generate &amp;Model Code
  Generating model project
    Generating Java class nl.remain.mx.model.impl.ModelPackageImpl failed with an unhandled exception
      ClassCastException: org.eclipse.jdt.internal.core.jdom.DOMField

Probaly the &quot;Literal&quot; object in &quot;Field&quot;

Here is the ecore model

            <thetext>ZRH got a couple of new laptop which have a dual core processor. Running Eclipse on such a hardware in most cases makes only use of one processor core (the task manager only shows 50% CPU). To fully leverage the power of these machine things like compiling or searching could be parallelized meaning that for compile we compile several independent files in || or for search we do the match resolving in parallel threads.</thetext>

            <thetext>Resolving this issue to parallelise a lot of internal functions of Eclipse will become mandatory in the very near future. Intel have already demonstrated a prototype of a 80 core CPU and within 5 years they expect it to come to the general marketplace. So it is in the interest of the Eclipse community to have as many important internal functions of Eclipse to work with multithreading. Already quadcore Intel CPUs are available now.</thetext>

From: Ed Merks &lt;merks@xxxxxxxxxx&gt; 
Date: Tue, 18 Jul 2006 16:52:16 -0400 
Newsgroups: eclipse.tools.emf 

Keith,

It seems to me that what we return should be handled properly as not specifying any help IDs, but since I can&apos;t tell the history of what&apos;s all changed in the Eclipse APIs since we coded to them way back when, I&apos;m fine with changing our method to return null now. If you open a bugzilla we&apos;ll fix it. As a workaround, you can override the createItemPropertyDescriptor in your generated item providers to return a derived ItemPropertyDescriptor that returns null for this method.

Keith Harrison-Broninski wrote:

Generate a template EMF editor, create an object, select it in the Properties view, then press F1. If you have the Error Log open you will see an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.

The problem seems to be that org.eclipse.emf.edit.provider.ItemPropertyDescriptor has this method:


  public Object getHelpContextIds(Object object)
  {
    return new String [] {};
  }

which appears to be deprecated - it should return either null or a single String, preferably &quot;org.eclipse.ui.property_sheet_page_help_context&quot; - which would allow the standard context-sensitive help for the Properties View to be displayed. Returning an empty array the causes a crash in the help listener created automatically by the ExtendedPropertySheetPage.

Is there a workaround for this?

I display the Error Log in my application and don&apos;t really want users seeing an exception on pressing something as innocent as F1 :-(

            <thetext>In my own workaround for this bug, I have over-ridden getHelpContextIds as shown below, to return a help context id specific to the object shown in the property sheet.  This means that context-sensitive help can be implemented appropriately for each different object if desired, rather than simply for the Properties view.

	/**
	 * Over-ridden to correct bug 151056.
	 * &lt;p&gt;
	 * The contextId returned will generally be of the form
	 * &quot;com.rolemodellers.rim.&lt;model element interface&gt;&quot;, e.g.,
	 * &quot;com.rolemodellers.rim.Identity&quot;.

            <thetext>IPropertyDescriptor.getHelpContextIds() no longer allows arrays of multiple contexts, so to keep up, our default should be null.

The fix is in CVS.</thetext>

            <thetext>I have a situation where we package jar files (with source files in a zipfile) in seperate projects, to have both final static libraries and be able to see them.

Now we have a situation where I want to deploy such a project which utilizes a _lot_ of projects with exported jar-files.  The &quot;Export Jar&quot; command only recognizes _compiled_ output and not exported jar files, making it less useful for us.

I therefore suggest the following enhancement:

* Exported jars from selected projects should be able to be copied to the same directory as the generated jar file transparently.  A checkbox?
* It should be able to generate a class path line in the manifest which contains the above mentioned jar files placed in the same directory.

I expect this to be a very valuable addition for the &quot;multiple-jar&quot; project which is not embedded in an application server or with a custom classloader.</thetext>

            <thetext>In the previous version of web tools, the whole schema could be displayed as a tree. In the new version I can only see the subnodes of the currently selected node. I would like to see the whole schema structure in one view, like it was possible in the previous version.</thetext>

            <thetext>I voted for this because I was deeply disappointed at the removal of this feature for 1.5.  I guess I don&apos;t understand the removal of something so helpful to visualizing the schema (in terms of how an XML instance would look) - this type of view is why XMLSpy is so popular and useful.  Perhaps it&apos;s not as technically correct, but it does allow one to more quickly understand the schema as a whole, by allowing the user to browse the schema in an instance-focused way.

Please bring it back, at least as another optional view.</thetext>

            <thetext>I voted for this as well and would like to say that I completely agree with Dallas Vaughan.

Replacing the current view with the original treeview might meet objection, but I don&apos;t see why the treeview shouldn&apos;t be available as an optional view. What harm would that do? 
The treeview code already exists anyway so it shouldn&apos;t be a great deal of work to  bring this feature back again.

I liked the treeview a lot and was very disappointed when I realized it had been replaced and I cannot help but add that I&apos;m unable to understand how this change could be carried out in the first place. To my mind, if asked whether they wanted the treeview out, 100 out of 100 XML developers would say that they insisted on this view. It&apos;s deprecation is just about as baffling to me as if a UML plugin vendor had replaced it&apos;s graphical UML views with advertisements for crayons. </thetext>

            <thetext>According to Sun&apos;s documentation you can have a quote inside a JSP EL string literal and you have to escape it with a backslash:

&gt; http://java.sun.com/j2ee/1.4/docs/tutorial/doc/JSPIntro7.html
&gt; ...
&gt; String: with single and double quotes; &quot; is escaped as \&quot;, &apos; is escaped as \&apos;,
&gt; and \ is escaped as \\.
&gt; ...

If you put in a JSP something like:
&lt;c:set var=&quot;myvar&quot; value=&quot;my \&quot;quoted\&quot; val&quot; /&gt;
${myvar}
it will execute fine and the string
my &quot;quoted&quot; val
will be displayed as expected.

The WTP editor however will highlight that code in red and will claim it contains the following errors:
- Attribute &quot;&quot;&quot; has no value
- Attribute &quot;\&quot; has no value

This is imho incorrect as the mentioned code is perfectly valid JSP EL and contains no errors.</thetext>

            <thetext>Renaming an aspect by Refactor&gt;Rename leads to the message:
&quot;This refactoring cannot be performed due to syntax errors in the compilation unit.
(...)&quot;

Renaming a pointcut: dito.

I am not sure if renaming an aspect or a pointcut is supported by AJDT.
Either the refactoring is blocked, or the message is misleading.

Environment: Eclipse Callisto with AJDT 1.4.0.</thetext>

            <thetext>This is a known issue. Refactor &gt; Rename causes JDT to try to interpret the aspect as a class. As a workaround there should be &quot;Rename...&quot; action directly on the right-click menu (ie not under the Refactor submenu) which does successfully rename aspects.</thetext>

            <thetext>Like what we did in web.xml,
	&lt;servlet-mapping&gt;
		&lt;servlet-name&gt;equinoxbridgeservlet&lt;/servlet-name&gt;
		&lt;url-pattern&gt;/*&lt;/url-pattern&gt;
	&lt;/servlet-mapping&gt;
we should be able to add url pattern servlet mapping in org.eclipse.equinox.http.registry.servlets extension point.

It will affects the implementation of the methods of HttpServletRequestAdaptor like getServletPath, getPathInfo.
This bug is from the integration of Tapestry, which uses getServletPath and getPathInfo as source of page name decoding.</thetext>

            <thetext>Hi John,

The http.registry maps the OSGi HttpService which does not specify support for wildcards. With that said, the Http Services pattern matching algorithm implicitly has the effect of using a wild-card so...

&quot;/garden/*&quot; in your web.xml should be equivalent to &quot;/garden&quot; when registered with the HttpService in terms of what getServletPath and getPathInfo return.

Does this work for you? If not could you post an example and we can look at doinig something implementation specific.

            <thetext>For my usage, there&apos;s no problem in transfering control to my servlet(tapestry ApplicationServlet in my case). Add an extension and put alias (garden), it will transfer control to my servlet. The problem lies in the implementation of the HttpServletRequestAdaptor, methods getServletPath and getPathInfo specifically. When I access &quot;http://..../garden/xxx.xx&quot;, in my servlet, when I use the method I get &quot;/garden&quot;. But if I&apos;m called directly from the container, the return value is &quot;/garden/xxx.xx&quot;. I think the HttpServletRequestAdaptor should act just as the regular container-provided HttpServletRequest. So the pattern mapping may be a new  mapping style.</thetext>

Hello WAR

Hi John,
I&apos;ve been experimenting with this in and am not seeing the container add the &quot;xxx.xx&quot; to the ServletPath as you described. I&apos;ve tried this in Tom Cat 5.5 and Jetty 6. (Also see pg. 39 of the 2.4 Servlet spec.)

Could you try this super basic WAR on your container to see if you can reproduce.

Is it possible that the ApplicationServlet is doing the mapping and that somehow the process is getting interfered with in another way?

            <thetext>Hi Simon,
I&apos;m sorry for the bothering. The mapping I used was 
	&lt;servlet-mapping&gt;
		&lt;servlet-name&gt;HelloServlet&lt;/servlet-name&gt;
		&lt;url-pattern&gt;*.xxx&lt;/url-pattern&gt;
	&lt;/servlet-mapping&gt;
not the &quot;/*&quot;, but the &quot;*.xxx&quot;, &quot;*.html&quot;.
Only in this case, the getServletPath and getPathInfo works like what I said.
In the &quot;/*&quot; case, there is no problem.</thetext>

            <thetext>Ah...
Ok, that&apos;s supported on the HEAD. (it&apos;s actually handled in org.eclipse.equinox.servlet.bridge.http)

Try &quot;/*.xxx&quot; or &quot;/garden/*.xxx&quot; as your alias.
Note: The leading slash is required by the HttpService -- also extension-mappings are namespaced by their prefix so &quot;/*.xxx&quot; and &quot;/garden/*.xxx&quot; are two distinct mappings.

Let me know if that works for you so we can close this.</thetext>

I&apos;m using the projects of cvs :pserver:anonymous@dev.eclipse.org:/cvsroot/eclipse/  equinox-incubator/org.eclipse.equinox.servlet.*. Am using the correct ones?</thetext>

            <thetext>Yes. That sounds right.
The changes were made in and around June 12th of this year.
You can synch to HEAD for those projects as they work fine with 3.2.</thetext>

            <thetext>StructuredDocument is not reloaded on ResourceChangedEvent

When a structured document has read-only regions, the document cannot be reloaded even on ResourceChangedEvent after the underlying file&apos;s modification.
The document cannot be reverted, neither.

Majour severity because the conflict between disk and FileBuffer can override some changes.


Observation:
Both &apos;revert&apos; and &apos;reload&apos; are the same reason. They reach ResourceTextFileBuffer#handleFileContent(), and call Basic(or JobSafe)StructuredDocument#set(String, long). Although BasicStructuredDocument#set(String) ignores read only settings, BasicStructuredDocument#set(String, long) does NOT. And the call of set(String, long) fails because of read-only. So, I think that set(String, long) should also ignore read only settings.</thetext>

            <thetext>Thanks for the observation.  That looks to be the problem.
In BasicStructuredDocument, change:
	public void set(String text, long modificationStamp) {
		try {
			replace(0, getLength(), text);
		}
		catch (BadLocationException exception) {
			Logger.logException(exception);
		}
		fModificationStamp = modificationStamp;
	}
to:
	public void set(String text, long modificationStamp) {
		 replaceText(null, 0, getLength(), text, true);

		fModificationStamp = modificationStamp;

            <thetext>The setMessage(String) does not work with the IStatusLineManager returned by getActionBars().getStatusLineManager() on an IViewSite.

The implementation is SubStatusLineManager. Looking at the code, line 115, it seems that this method invokes setMessage(String) on the parent StatusLineManager, which slightly differs from the previous method setErrorMessage(String), which works fine but invokes the setErrorMessage(Image, String) on the parent StatusLineManager, passing null as the image.

Strangely, the setMessage(Image, String) works fine, passing null as image.

I looked a bit further in the code but did not find the cause of this bug.

Workaround: use setMessage(null, yourString).

Denis Jouvin.</thetext>

            <thetext>Provide support support for JUnit V4.

As for April 2006, JUnit V4 (http://www.instrumentalservices.com/media/articles/java/junit4/JUnit4.pdf) has been released (http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?forum_id=541181).  Currently, Eclipse V3.2 ships JUnit V4.1.0.  The TPTP JUnit and JUnit plug-in support should be updated to support JUnit V4 including:

-Updating the TPTP JUnit and JUnit plug-in test wizards to query the user for the version of the imported/generated JUint test.
-Updating the TPTP JUnit and JUnit plug-in test editor to support the new structure of JUnit V4 tests.
-Updating the TPTP JUnit and JUnit plug-in test generator to generated JUnit V4 test classes.
-Updating the TPTP JUnit and JUnit plug-in test runner to run JUnit V4 test classes.</thetext>

            <thetext>I have run into a problem in using the ECrossReferenceAdapter (via CacheAdapter) in the UML metamodel.  I am finding that containment proxies are being resolved (and, hence, resources loaded) when I don&apos;t want them to be, and the cause seems to the in the ECrossReferenceAdapter.resolveAll(EObject) method. 
 
Attached is a JUnit test that demonstrates.  It creates four resources, all of which have contain exactly one object.  One of these resources contains a UML Model that cross-resource-contains three Packages (stored in the other resources).  If I load one of the Package resources and perform a reverse-reference query (using the adapter) on the package that it contains, then I find that the other two Package resources are also loaded (depending on the ordering of the list of contained packages). 
 
Also attached is a one-line patch for the ECrossReferenceAdapter.resolveAll(EObject) method that does the indexOf(proxy) search on the basic list view of a list setting, instead of assuming that the list will not resolve proxies in its indexOf() implementation.  All of EMF&apos;s list implementations do not resolve proxies in the indexOf() except as a last resort, but the DerivedUnionEObjectEList in UML does resolve.</thetext>

Hi

Some more info about this exception (I&apos;m using Eclipse 3.1.2). 


In CPPSemantics.java, function: getTargetParameterTypes(), Line 2141 is:
	cls = (ICPPClassType)
CPPTemplates.instantiateWithinClassTemplate( (ICPPClassTemplate) cls );


Inside instantiateWithinClassTemplate() method in CPPTemplates.java, control goes to following loop, for certain methods

		if( template instanceof CPPClassTemplate ){
			return ((CPPClassTemplate)template).instantiate(
args );
		} 

And as soon as control returns to CPPSemantics.java, where conversion to ICPPClassType is made, exception is thrown.

If any other info might be required, please let me know.


Regards
Virender.

Hi Folks

For one of my plug-ins, I&apos;m adding some default directories to the list of Includes for the projects. These directories are symbolic links to standard include directories for the compiler that we are using (aCC).
However, if link to one particular directory is added
(/.../aCC/include_std) and then C/C++ Full Indexer is enabled, then I get an exception, which starts as given below. Are there any restrictions on what can be added to Include Paths ? Am I doing something wrong or is it an Eclipse bug ?

Regards
Virender.

            <thetext>&gt; You mention you are using Eclipse 3.1.2. Are you really using CDT 3.1? Or was
&gt; this CDT 3.0.x? If it was CDT 3.1, did you try the Fast indexer?


This exception came with Eclipse 3.1.2 and I was using CDT_3_0_2_RC1 plugins. I tried with Eclipse 3.2 + CDT 3.1. No exception shows up in console window (as for CDT 3.0.x). However, it seems that contents of this include (../aCC/include_std) have not been indexed. When I do C/C++ Search for some method declared inside this include directory (say, cout declared in iostream.h), nothing is returned. I get correct search results for some of the other include directories that I checked (say, printf declared in stdio.h).

            <thetext>O.K. since the exception isn&apos;t present in 3.1, I&apos;ll move this off the 3.1.1 list. The severity is lower and I&apos;m not sure I&apos;ll be address it since I don&apos;t have an aCC install to try things out with.</thetext>

            <thetext>I migrated from Eclipse 3.1 to 3.2 this morning (installed 3.2 and opened the old workplace).
Had some problems with my cvs-stored project (cvs update processes hanging, conflicts only when committing but not when comparing), so I decided to restart the computer (well, its windows...)

Now I cannot start Eclipse (Alert box: &quot;An error has occured. See the log file&quot;). This is printed in log:

            <thetext>When the &quot;set&quot; button is clicked with a specific rule set chosen, the rules are corrcetly selected in the rule tree, but the &quot;apply&quot; button is not enabled. Thus, the rules will not actually be used when you click &quot;analyze.&quot; 

When the tree is expanded after the rule set has been selected with the &quot;set&quot; button, the &quot;apply&quot; button is suddenly enabled again, and clicking that button causes the rule set to be correctly applied. This is *not* a good work-around though, since it is far from obvious.

The fix looks to be simple -- when the set button is clicked, enable the apply button.

The original report from Harish Dewan follows:

This is related to Java Static analysis rules. When I select any of the
java rule sets from the &apos;Rule Sets&apos; combo box  and click on the &apos;Set&apos;
button the  corresponding java rules are selected in the &apos;Rules&apos; tab but

When I analyze the code with the rule set it shows zero results. 
It shows me proper results only when I expand the tree in &apos;Rules&apos; tab
after rule set selection. 
Steps for reproducing the problem: 
1) In the analysis launch configuration dialog box set &apos;Java Best
Practices&apos; as rule set. The best practices rules get selected in the
rules section. 
2) Invoke analysis button and there will be zero results. 
But if we expand the rules tree before step 2 the results are properly
generated. 
In short the rules tree should be clicked or set focused before the
analysis is done.

Is this a common behavior or only I am facing the problem?

Thanks &amp; Regards
Harish.</thetext>

To make mylar.tasks.core the place that encapsulates our http/url connections, I extracted our URLConnection code into mylar.internal.tasks.core.UrlConnectionUtil.  This will help ensure that we use consistent proxy and ssl connections.  You can add the HTTPClient code you need to that class.</thetext>

Replaces all uses of URLConnection by HttpClient

I have setup a repository that requires digest authentication at http://mylar.eclipse.org/trac010digest . Some of the Trac test cases now require a credentials.properties file identical to the one used by Bugzilla (this completes part of the work for bug 150456).

&gt; Should 0.6.0.v20060727-1630 be able to do digest authentication? It didn&apos;t work
&gt; for me, it still tried to do &quot;basic&quot; authentication. Do I need to explicitly
&gt; (sp?) configure it to use digest?

Yes, it should do digest authentication. I think the library tries basic authentication first before attempting digest authentication. There is no special configuration option.

Are you using the &quot;XML-RPC&quot; or &quot;Trac 0.9&quot; mode to access the repository?</thetext>

I had &quot;http://server/trac/projectfoo/&quot; as the repository URL. Changing it to &quot;http://server/trac/projectfoo&quot; (no trailing slash) did it.</thetext>

            <thetext>Mik, thanks for checking back but I was intending to say with my comment from bug #140512 (https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=140512#c12) that my browser is currently non-functional, not Mylar related rather AMD64, https, etc. etc. Other bugs to file, perhaps, but I won&apos;t be able to test the new build. Again, thanks, and as soon as I have my other issues worked out, I&apos;ll get back on the boat.</thetext>

            <thetext>Daniel: The trailing slash problem is bug 150890 and will hopefully be fixed before the release since others are bound to encounter this problem.

Josh: we have some Linux-specific browser troubleshooting instructions at: http://wiki.eclipse.org/index.php/Mylar_FAQ#Installing_on_Linux  If you could add your problems there that would be great (e.g. indicate that Eclipse&apos;s browser won&apos;t work on AMD64 with any OS specific details, you could make a new section if not running Linux).  That would help others in the same boat as you.  Also note that https will be working on Linux in an upcoming release if it isn&apos;t already (bug 80033).</thetext>

            <thetext>After installing a fresh 3.2 and using the old workspace with -data, team-&gt;synchronize is broken.
1) Selecting a package fails to find new a sub-package in repository.E.g. I have com.x.y.a, com.x.y.b and a new package com.x.y.c is there. Select synchronize on the com.x.y package says &quot;No changes Found&quot;. If I touch the file, do F5 and then Replace with Latest from HEAD it works. 
2) Select com.x.y only finds changes in files within com.x.y and does not recurse. I am forced to manually traverse the entire source tree doing synchronize on bottom level packages.

3.1 did not have these problems.

            <thetext>Why can&apos;t you just synchronize the project? Alternatively, if your packages are contained in a source folder, you can synchronize the source folder. 

What you can do is switch the sync view to Workspace mode using the dropdown toolbar item that is third from the left and then set that to hierarchy mode in the Sync View preferences.</thetext>

            <thetext>We change WorkbenchWindow Title accoring to file processed in our RPC-based tool. Code goes like this:

if (PlatformUI.getWorkbench().getActiveWorkbenchWindow() != null &amp;&amp;
    PlatformUI.getWorkbench().getActiveWorkbenchWindow().getShell() != null) {
      PlatformUI.getWorkbench()
        .getActiveWorkbenchWindow().getShell().setText(title);
    }

Application(Workbench) window changes appropriatelly, ToolTip on WinXP platform either, but the name of the application in TaskBar does not (see attached picture).

            <thetext>The following snippet raises a warning which is trivially incorrect:

WARN: The variable result can only be null; it was either set to null or checked for null when last used.

    public class Test {
        public static Object foo() {
            Object result = null;
            try {
                result = new Object();
            } catch (Exception e) {
                result = null;
            }
            return result;
        }

            <thetext>Copying the test case to label lines:

    public class Test {
        public static Object foo() {
            Object result = null;            // a
            try {
                result =                     // b 
                         new Object();       // c
            } catch (Exception e) {
                result = null;               // d
            }
            return result;
        }
    }

The only way to get to line d is to get an exception while executing line c, in effect skipping the assignment line b. Since line a assigns null to result, result is still null line d.</thetext>

            <thetext>BTW, this may come from a simplification of your original test case. We do have a few issues when try/catch and loops are involved.</thetext>

            <thetext>Okay, so the test was actually too minimal. Here&apos;s a slightly expanded test for which your analysis does not hold:

    public static class Test2 {
        public static Object foo() {
            Object result = null;
            try {
                result = new Object(); // a&apos;
                result = new Object(); // b&apos;
            } catch (Exception e) {
                result = null; // c&apos;: warning here
            }
            return result;
        }
    }

Now control can arrive at c&apos; if an exception is raised by b&apos;, which is after the assignment at a&apos;. But that does seem awfully pedantic. Here are some examples which are closer to the originally problematic code:

    public static class Test3 {
        public static Object foo(java.sql.ResultSet rs) {
            Object result = null;
            try {
            	while (rs.next()) { 
            		result = rs.getObject(1); // a&apos;&apos;
            	}
            } catch (Exception e) {
                result = null; // b&apos;&apos;: arrive here after possibly many
                               //      assignments at a&apos;&apos;
            }
            return result;
        }
    }

    public static class Test4 {
        public static Object foo(java.sql.ResultSet rs) {
            Object result = null;
            try {
            	result = new Object(); // a&apos;&apos;&apos;
            	bar();
            } catch (Exception e) {
                result = null; // b&apos;&apos;&apos;: arrive here when a RuntimeException 
                               //       is raised at c&apos;&apos;&apos;, which follows the
                               //       assignment at a&apos;&apos;&apos;
            }
            return result;
        }
        private static void bar() {
            throw new RuntimeException();
        }
    }</thetext>

            <thetext>Released NullReferenceTest # 564 to 566. These tests succeed as fixed by the fix of bug 150082, hence I&apos;ll close this bug as a duplicate.
Moreover, my initial answer to comment #1 was wrong. An exception could happen at the end of the assignment that should be caught by the Exception catch, hence the first test case should not complain either. This is reflected in NullReferenceTest # 564.

            <thetext>Is your enhancement because current toString wrong? Or, you just want it to be better? For use in some program logic? If so, I&apos;d suggest making a new function, instead of using &quot;toString&quot;, as that&apos;s typically &quot;for debugging&quot; and seldom &quot;API&quot; in the normal sense of the word. (That is, normally what it returns would not be gaurenteed from one release to another). 

Perhaps &quot;mergedText&quot; would be a good name?

            <thetext>Object#toString() is commonly only to be used for debugging purposes (exept if explicitly specified otherwise). The format is unspecified and should only serve the (human) debugger. In this case, I found that showing the children would generally be useful if you need to look at TextEdits. So:
- it was not &quot;wrong&quot;, just not as useful as it could be
- I would never base any program logic on the unspecified result of toString()</thetext>

            <thetext>Thanks Markus.

Fixed in HEAD with some minor (Java)doc additions and verified that deleting methods which still appear in the hierarchy is a binary compatible change.

            <thetext>I have created a Data Source, and am trying to create a data set.  I start by selecting the nodes I want with the XPath query //node-name.  I then start adding columns.  One column I would like to add is ancestor::parent-node/other-child.  I have to use the ancestor:: axis because I don&apos;t know how far up the particular parent node I want is.  I haven&apos;t been able to test other XPath axis expressions as of yet, but I will update with other ones as I can.  Thanks.</thetext>

            <thetext>Not being able to use predecessor:: also makes finding unique values in an XML document impossible (at least with XPath alone).  This would be very handy in creating charts.  In my case, I have a list of elements all with various values to a certain attribute.  I want a list of those distinct attributes and a count of how many share that value for use in a pie chart.</thetext>

            <thetext>When the SourceLookupFacility reuses an already open editor (openEditor method calls setInput), the new IEditiorInput is not added to the workbench&apos;s editor history.

If a page.openEditor is called, then the workbench editor history is updated.

Problem can be demonstrated with the JDT.
To recreate the problem:
   Make sure the Run/Debug preferences is set to reuse editors
   Set a breakpoint somewhere in a Java program
      (The breakpoint will need to be several calls deep through different classes).
   Close All Editors
   (Open and close enough editors on class files you will not be debugging, to fill up the MRU with irrelevant files)
   Execute the Java program and hit the breakpoint.
   The file with the breakpoint should be opened automatically.
   Notice that the file should have been added to the MRU (under the File menu)
   Now using the Debug View, click back into the stack frame to a method that is in another class.
   The editor should switch to that class.
   Check the MRU list.  It should not be showing the 2nd class like I think it should.

Basically, SourceLookupFacility.openEditor(...) will call setInput on the editor directly if it is an IReusableEditor and it is already opened.   This bypasses the IWorkbenchPage.openEditor call.   If the IWorkbenchPage.openEditor call was made, then eventually the workbench&apos;s EditorHistory would be modified.

The IWorkbenchPage interface defines a reuseEditor() method that I think should be being called instead.</thetext>

            <thetext>Doesn&apos;t seem to be working when you select another frame.

The following simple exmaple demonstrates:

public class C1 {
	public void foo() {
		System.out.println(&quot;breakpoint&quot;); //breakpoint here
	}
}

public class C2 {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		C1 c1 = new C1();
		c1.foo();
	}
}

Run C2 following the steps above, and notice that if you select the stack frame for C2 while suspended at C1, the C2 editor is not added to the MRU editor list.

As we are now using the workbench page&apos;s method I&apos;ll kick it over to them for comment.</thetext>

            <thetext>When a project is located on a remote filesystem (e.g. a WebDAV server) and this project is closed when starting Eclipse, Eclipse will cause cconnection attempts to that remote system.
This is especially undesirable if those projects were closed because the remote system was shut down in the first place.

The following is a stacktrace of Eclipse&apos;s first attempt to reach a remote system at startup, followed by some clarification.


8	WebDAVFileSystem.getStore(URI) line: 49
7	InternalFileSystemCore.getStore(URI) line: 107
6	EFS.getStore(URI) line: 296
5	FileStoreRoot.toLocalPath(URI) line: 120
4	FileStoreRoot.&lt;init&gt;(URI, IPath) line: 57
3	FileSystemResourceManager.setLocation(IResource, ResourceInfo, URI) line: 806
2	Project.internalSetDescription(IProjectDescription, boolean) line: 663
1	SaveManager.restoreMetaInfo(Project, IProgressMonitor) line: 782
	SaveManager.restoreMetaInfo(MultiStatus, IProgressMonitor) line: 746
	SaveManager.restore(IProgressMonitor) line: 637
	SaveManager.startup(IProgressMonitor) line: 1299
	Workspace.startup(IProgressMonitor) line: 1883
	Workspace.open(IProgressMonitor) line: 1653
	ResourcesPlugin.startup() line: 367
  ...


1	SaveManager.restoreMetaInfo(Project, IProgressMonitor) line: 782
A project description is tried to be read; if the project is closed, it cannot be read and a dummy IProjectDescription is created. This description is then set with an internal method (the API method setDescription can only be used on existing open projects).


2	Project.internalSetDescription(IProjectDescription, boolean) line: 663
For some reason Eclipse interprets a closed project as being a resource that has its location changed and so it is set again (to a WebDAV location: webdav://).


3	FileSystemResourceManager.setLocation(IResource, ResourceInfo, URI) line: 806
To set the location, a new FileStoreRoot is created with root URI the URI of the remote project location (webdav://).


4	FileStoreRoot.&lt;init&gt;(URI, IPath) line: 57
The FileStoreRoot constructor tries to find out the local file that corresponds with the given WebDAV URI. If this is not possible, null will be stored (eventually this will happen, but only after the nonreachable remote system has been tried to be contacted).


5	FileStoreRoot.toLocalPath(URI) line: 120	
The filesystem corresponding to the URI scheme (webdav) is requested with EFS.


6	EFS.getStore(URI) line: 296	
An IFileStore is requested for the given WebDAV URI.


7	InternalFileSystemCore.getStore(URI) line: 107	
The IFileSystem corresponding with the scheme of the given URI (webdav) is retrieved (WebDAVFileSystem). This filesystem is asked for an IFileStore representing the given URI.


8	WebDAVFileSystem.getStore(URI) line: 49	
An attempt is made to create a WebDAVFileStore that represents the given URI. If it is not possible to create a file store corresponding to the provided URI, a file store belonging to the null file system should be returned.
However, in order to know whether it is possible to create a file store, the WebDAV server should be contacted to determine if it responds.


In my opinion, step 3 is the strangest: why must a closed project have its location set?</thetext>

            <thetext>Thank you for this detailed analysis.  One thing to note is that certain IFileSystem/IFileStore methods are &quot;handle only&quot; methods. They can be identified with statements in the javadoc like:

&quot;This is a handle-only method; &lt;blah&gt; is returned regardless of whether this store exists.&quot;

As it turns out, IFileSystem.getStore(...) does not have this exact template, but I will fix the doc.  Your implementations of these methods should not contact the backing file system.  This is quite important, because these methods provide no IProgressMonitor context for reporting progress and/or allowing cancelation.  Any operation that connects to a backing file system is potentially long-running.  

In any case, there really is no reason to contact the file system for these handle methods - they are really only functional operations on the handle itself. If you fix your WebDAV implementation accordingly, does it still attempt to connect to the backing file system for a closed project? If so, it is certainly a bug that I will address.

            <thetext>Note that we need to compute the location of closed projects to satisfy the contract of IResource.getLocation(), which specifies that the location is computed regardless of whether the resource&apos;s project is open or closed.  It turns out to be useful in various situations to know where a project is located even when it is closed.</thetext>

            <thetext>Thank you for your quick and helpful reply; if I postpone the contacting of the server to non-handle-only methods in my implementation of IFileStore, the server is indeed not contacted for closed projects.

I do have one other question: what should the behaviour of the Properties View and  Properties Dialog (and maybe other UI elements that request metadata) be for closed projects? These UI elements do force a connection to retrieve information, regardless of whether the project is closed.
I assume there has once been some debate as to whether metadata of closed projects may be retrieved. With the coming of generic filesystems, it might be appropriate to restart this debate.</thetext>

            <thetext>From a user interface perspective, the easiest way to attach to a JVM would be
to support the new attach-on-demand API in Mustang like JConsole does.  It
would probably still be necessary to launch the debuggee in some special
manner.  Still, it should be possible to free the user from needing to manually
engage in socket accounting.

Attach on demand

The UI it enables for JConsole
http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/alanb?entry=getting_started_with_jconsole_just

In addition to being an enhancement, this would be a work-around.  It is relatively easy to accidentally construct launch conditions that will execute using run, but not debug.  This would provide better debug support for those cases.</thetext>

If there&apos;s only stub servers runtime install, no server created, and the user chooses START on the service scale, a banner message is displayed to state that &quot;Server has only stub runtimes associated with it so the server will not be created or started&quot;.  This is fine if the user only choose service side since the scale setting would be automatically set to DEPLOY by the wizard if there&apos;s only stub server.  However, if the user also choose to START on client scale, the user would get stuck on the proxy generation page and the console would have this error:

            <thetext>ClientExtensionDefaultingCommand is updated to set install, start and test to false if there&apos;s only stub runtime.

We decided not to change the visual behaviour on the 1st page (i.e. clip what the user can enter on service or client side) but rather rely on the banner warning to indicate to the user that since there&apos;s only stub runtime, the server would not be created or started.

The fix has been committed and will be released later on today.</thetext>

This problem occurs every time a commons-logging.1.0.4.jar is in the classpath.
This jar is provided either by hibernate-tools-plugin or org.apache.batik.pdf_1.6.0.v20060613-1220.
The latter one is even more confusing since the class org.apache.commons.logging.impl.Log4JLogger is
contained inside the jar lib\pdf-transcoder.jar.
If we remove the hibernate-plugins and org.apache.batik.pdf_1.6.0.v20060613-1220 everything works
fine. Checking with the jvm-option -verbose:class reveals that instead of Log4JLogger now Jdk14Logger
is beeing loaded from:
Loaded org.apache.commons.logging.impl.Jdk14Logger from file:/C:/dev/eclipse-SDK-3.2-win32/eclipse/plugins/org.eclipse.tomcat_4.1.130.v20060601/commons-logging-api.jar]
This only happens when our own plugins reference log4j.

We have several questions:

1. Why are classes of commons-logging bundled in the jars:
org.eclipse.tomcat_4.1.130.v20060601/commons-logging-api.jar
org.apache.batik.pdf_1.6.0.v20060613-1220/lib\pdf-transcoder.jar
This makes it very difficult to write plugins.

2. Is there a way of keeping the above plugins since we need both birt and hibernate-plugins.

Any help on this is highly appreciated.

Peter Fopma

&quot;The latter one is even more confusing since the class
org.apache.commons.logging.impl.Log4JLogger is

As a work around for now, you can remove org.apache.batik.pdf_1.6.0.v20060613-1220.  This plugin is for generating PDF from chart when chart is not used inside a report.  Unless you are using chart engine independently, you can safely remove this plugin.

As for the class conflict between the hibernate plugin and the commons-logging.1.0.4.jar  on the class path.  Do you want to try remove the commons-logging.1.0.4.jar  in the hibernate-tools-plugin but keeping the rest of the plugin?

But in general, Eclipse&apos;s OSGi framework need to find a way to resolve class conflicts among plugins and class on the class path.    Please post a question in the Equinox project&apos;s news group or log a bugzilla for this project.

            <thetext>thanks for the hints.
After debuggen some hours in this area we found some more:

1. I am not an expert of plugin class loading, but in my limited knowledge the situation may be the following:
Usually a plugin hides the jars it uses itself.
Our own plugin is doing this with the log4j.jar.
So other plugins will not see the log4j.jar if they are programmed well.
However the Birt-Viewer plugin bypasses this plugin encapsulation.
Our problem occurs in class org.eclipse.birt.report.viewer.utilities.ViewerClassLoaderWrapper
there the log4j classes are loaded via the following code:

public Class loadClass( String className ) throws ClassNotFoundException
{
	try
	{
		return bundle.loadClass( className );
	}
	catch(ClassNotFoundException e)
	{
			
		for ( Iterator it = othersBundles.iterator( ); it.hasNext( ); )
		{
			try
			{
				String name = (String) it.next( );
				Bundle b = findBundle(name);
				if (b != null)
				{
					return b.loadClass(className);
				}
			}
			catch(ClassNotFoundException ee)
			{
				
			}
			}
	}
	throw new ClassNotFoundException(&quot;class not fond name is &quot; + className);
}

This method direct calls the bundle classloaders. I am certainly not an expert in this case, but to me this seems to be the root cause of the problems. Please correct me if I am wrong.

2. The commons-logging-api.jar is part of the release commons-logging 1.0.3.
I could solve our problem when patching this jar. The patched version
returns false in method isLog4JAvailable()  of class org.apache.commons.logging.impl.LogFactoryImpl:

   protected boolean isLog4JAvailable() {
	return false;
   }

So log4j is not used by the tomcat plugin.
I can keep the batik and hibernate plugins and leave our own plugin as it is.
This is certainly a hack.</thetext>

            <thetext>The pdftranscoder.jar released by batik does contain the common logging classes.   Wenfeng is correct... the org.apache.batik.pdf_1.6.0.v20060613-1220 plugin is only needed by the Chart Engine in stand alone mode.   For your case you don&apos;t need this plugin.</thetext>

            <thetext>Thanks Sheldon,
this would be another workaround.
In my previous posting I desribed that the 
ViewerClassLoaderWrapper may be using a wrong classloading
strategy. Is this right ? Because this may be the root cause
for our problems and would be for a lot of further problems.

I think you are right that fixing the class loading issue could prevent other potential class conflicts.   </thetext>

No its not in tomcats classpath its contained in our own plugin

&gt; Could you provide the fail case?

I will do so in the next days.

&gt; If it&apos;s in the tomcat&apos;s classpath, the fail is not related to that class
&gt; loading code even we need fix that code also.

Fixing this would really help us.

            <thetext>Is this issue only related to the birt designer?

I think there is feature dependency of chart to this plugin, if we remove this plugin from the designer packate, Eclipse update manager will give error.

It would be better to fix the code in the designer&apos;s class loader wrapper to avoid other potential class conflicts.</thetext>

getUndoCommand will usually return null because the command is removed just prior to this call. Also the dirty state is not set in this method at all, and at the time of the call it is false.</thetext>

            <thetext>I am looking into this defect. At first it seem to not be a problem, but later we discovered that the server that the adopter is trying to use is throwing a event that it is making the object dirty. 

This defect is still valid and more investigation needs to be done.</thetext>

Eclipse patch for this defect

Tim, 

I was not able to assign this defect to me, I guess it is because I am not a comitter yet. So, I had to attach the patch for this bug as an attachment. When you get a chance you can commit it.


I modified the &quot;if&quot; statement. The logic was not correct, the point of the &quot;if&quot; statement is to check if the command is undoable. If true, meaning the change can be undone, the server should be marked dirty; if false, the server should be marked not dirty. In addition, for the cases when the canCompletelyUndo return false, it didn&apos;t add much value to do a check if there was a next undo event or not(getUndoCommand(src.id) == null). I don&apos;t think the list of undo events should be a factor for marking the server dirty or not.

            <thetext>Found a bug in the patch - servers would not be marked non-dirty when undoing initial changes (i.e. before save). The solution I found was to remove canCompletelyUndo (a boolean stating if changes can be undone) and adding undoSaveIndex (a int that stores the last &quot;save state&quot; of the undo stack. By resetting where the save state is in the stack, the undo and redo can set the dirty state that way instead of checking whether the stack is empty.</thetext>

            <thetext>- The SemanticEditPolicy was changed about 6 months ago to return null instead of an unexecutable command if it doesn&apos;t find a command.  A side effect of this change is that if a client does not support reorienting one of their relationship types, but do not return an unexecutable command in the edithelper (which they never had to before), they would now be able to reorient their connection to a note or anything on the diagram.

- I am attaching a solution that Linda and I have come up with.  However, it hasn&apos;t quite been fully tested yet and there is one known issue: note attachments can now be reoriented to anything.  e.g. you could reorient a note attachment between two classes.  I don&apos;t know how we would fix this or how it worked before.</thetext>

            <thetext>Fixed.  The GMF SemanticEditPolicy now distinguishes between reference connections and purely notational connections. Reorienting a reference connection will consult the edit helpers for a semantic command.  Reorienting notation-only connections (e.g., note attachment) will not consult the edit helpers for a semantic command.</thetext>

            <thetext>Create new Corona collaboration component: ProjectContainerCache.

The ProjectContainerCache is responsible for managing the ProjectContainer(s) that are locally known by the Eclipse Workbench.  Workbench plug-ins such as ProjectContianerExplorer and ProjectContainerView utilize the ProjectContainerCache to discover and access the ProjectContainers available to the local Eclipse Workbench.</thetext>

This view should be modeled after the Package Explorer.

The ProjectContainerExplorer is dependent upon the ProjectContainerCache.</thetext>
